As an administrator, you can customize the content of the portal using the visual editor. 

:::image type="content" source="media/api-management-developer-portal-editor/visual-editor.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the visual editor in the developer portal." :::

* Use the menu options on the left to create or modify pages, media, layouts, menus, styles, or website settings. 

* On the top, switch between viewports (for screens of different sizes), or view the elements of the portal visible to users in different [groups](../articles/api-management/api-management-howto-create-groups.md). For example, you might want to display certain pages only to groups that are associated with particular products, or to users that can access specific APIs.

* Also, save or undo changes you make, or publish the website.
