An [Azure Resource Manager template](../articles/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview.md) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax. You describe your intended deployment without writing the sequence of programming commands to create the deployment.
