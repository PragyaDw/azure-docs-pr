# Azure Private 5G Core 2404 release notes

The following release notes identify the new features, critical open issues, and resolved issues for the 2404 release of Azure Private 5G Core (AP5GC). The release notes are continuously updated, with critical issues requiring a workaround added as they’re discovered. Before deploying this new version, review the information contained in these release notes.

This article applies to the AP5GC 2404 release (2404.0-3). This release is compatible with the Azure Stack Edge (ASE) Pro 1 GPU and Azure Stack Edge Pro 2 running the ASE 2403 release and supports the 2024-04-01, 2023-09-01, 2023-06-01 and 2022-11-01 [Microsoft.MobileNetwork](/rest/api/mobilenetwork) API versions. 

For more information about compatibility, see [Packet core and Azure Stack Edge compatibility](azure-stack-edge-packet-core-compatibility.md). 

For more information about new features in Azure Private 5G Core, see [What's New Guide](whats-new.md).

This release has been produced in accordance with Microsoft’s Secure Development Lifecycle, including processes for authorizing software changes, antimalware scanning, and scanning and mitigating security bugs and vulnerabilities.

## Support lifetime

Packet core versions are supported until two subsequent versions are released (unless otherwise noted). You should plan to upgrade your packet core in this time frame to avoid losing support.

### Currently supported packet core versions
The following table shows the support status for different Packet Core releases and when they're expected to no longer be supported.

| Release | Support Status |
|---------|----------------|
| AP5GC 2404 | Supported until AP5GC 2410 is released |
| AP5GC 2403 | Supported until AP5GC 2408 is released |
| AP5GC 2310 and earlier | Out of Support |

## What's new

### High Availability

We're excited to announce that AP5GC is now resilient to system failures when run on a two-node ASE cluster. Userplane traffic, sessions, and registrations are unaffected on failure of any single pod, physical interface, or ASE device.

### In Service Software Upgrade 

In our commitment to continuous improvement and minimizing service impact we’re excited to announce that, upgrading from this version to a future release will include the capability for In-Service Software Upgrades (ISSU).

ISSU is supported for deployments on a 2-node cluster, software upgrades can be performed seamlessly, ensuring minimal disruption to your services. The upgrade completes with no loss of sessions or registrations and minimal packet loss and packet reordering. Should the upgrade fail, the software will automatically roll back to the previous version, also with minimal service disruption.

### Azure Resource Health 

This feature allows you to monitor the health of your control plane resource using Azure Resource Health.  Azure Resource Health is a service that processes and displays health signals from your resource and displays the health in the Azure portal. This service gives you a personalized dashboard showing all the times your resource was unavailable or in a degraded state, along with recommended actions to take to restore health.

For more information, on using Azure Resource Health to monitor the health of your deployment, see [Resource Health overview](../service-health/resource-health-overview.md).

### NAS Encryption

NAS (Non-Access-Stratum) encryption configuration determines the encryption algorithm applied to the management traffic between the UEs and the AMF(5G) or MME(4G). By default, for security reasons, Packet Core deployments are configured to preferentially use NEA2/EEA2 encryption.

You can change the preferred encryption level after deployment by [modifying the packet core configuration](modify-packet-core.md).

<!--## Issues fixed in the AP5GC 2404 release
# NO FIXED ISSUES IN AP5GC2404

The following table provides a summary of issues fixed in this release.

  |No.  |Feature  | Issue |  SKU Fixed In |

  |No.  |Feature  | Issue | Workaround/comments |
  |-----|---------|-------|---------------------|
  | 1 | Local distributed tracing | Local Dashboard Unavailable for 5-10 minutes after device failure | After the failure of a device in a two-node cluster, Azure Private 5G Core local dashboards won't be available for five to ten minutes. Once they recover, information for the time that they weren't available isn't shown. |
  | 2 | Local distributed tracing | When deployed on a two-node cluster, Azure Private 5G Core local dashboards can show an incorrect count for the number of PDU Sessions.   | |

The following table provides a summary of known issues carried over from the previous releases.

  |No.  |Feature  | Issue | Workaround/comments |
  |-----|-----|-----|-----|
  | 1 | Local distributed tracing | When a web proxy is enabled on the Azure Stack Edge appliance that the packet core is running on and Azure Active Directory is used to authenticate access to AP5GC Local Dashboards, the traffic to Azure Active Directory doesn't transmit via the web proxy. If there's a firewall blocking traffic that doesn't go via the web proxy then enabling Azure Active Directory causes the packet core install to fail. | Disable Azure Active Directory and use password based authentication to authenticate access to AP5GC Local Dashboards instead. |
