# Tutorial: Build and deploy a question and answer copilot with the Azure AI CLI and SDK

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

In this [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com) tutorial, you use the Azure AI CLI and SDK to build, configure, and deploy a copilot for your retail company called Contoso Trek. Your retail company specializes in outdoor camping gear and clothing. The copilot should answer questions about your products and services. For example, the copilot can answer questions such as "which tent is the most waterproof?" or "what is the best sleeping bag for cold weather?".

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSUWCbFnQ14]

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription.

    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at <a href="https://aka.ms/oai/access" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/oai/access</a>. Open an issue on this repo to contact us if you have an issue.

- You need an Azure AI hub resource and your user role must be **Azure AI Developer**, **Contributor**, or **Owner** on the Azure AI hub resource. For more information, see [Azure AI hub resources](../concepts/ai-resources.md) and [Azure AI roles](../concepts/rbac-ai-studio.md).
    - If your role is **Contributor** or **Owner**, you can [create an Azure AI hub resource in this tutorial](#create-an-azure-ai-project-in-azure-ai-studio). 
    - If your role is **Azure AI Developer**, the Azure AI hub resource must already be created. 

- Your subscription needs to be below your [quota limit](../how-to/quota.md) to [deploy a new model in this tutorial](#deploy-the-chat-function-to-an-api). Otherwise you already need to have a [deployed chat model](../how-to/deploy-models-openai.md).

## Create an Azure AI project in Azure AI Studio

Your Azure AI project is used to organize your work and save state while building your copilot. During this tutorial, your project contains your data, prompt flow runtime, evaluations, and other resources. For more information about the Azure AI projects and resources model, see [Azure AI hub resources](../concepts/ai-resources.md).

[!INCLUDE [Create AI project](../includes/create-projects.md)]

## Launch VS Code from Azure AI Studio

In this tutorial, you use a prebuilt custom container via [Visual Studio Code (Web)](../how-to/develop-in-vscode.md) in Azure AI Studio. 

1. Go to [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com).

1. Go to **Build** > **Projects** and select or create the project you want to work with.

1. At the top-right of any page in the **Build** tab, select **Open project in VS Code (Web)** to work in the browser. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/open-vs-code-web.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the button that opens Visual Studio Code web in Azure AI Studio." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/open-vs-code-web.png":::

1. Select or create a compute instance. You need a compute instance to use the prebuilt custom container.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/create-compute.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dialog to create compute in Azure AI Studio." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/create-compute.png":::

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You're charged for compute instances while they are running. To avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs, pause the compute instance when you're not actively working in Visual Studio Code (Web) or Visual Studio Code (Desktop). For more information, see [how to start and stop compute](../how-to/create-manage-compute.md#start-or-stop-a-compute-instance).

1. Once the compute is running, select **Set up** which configures the container on your compute for you. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/compute-set-up.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the dialog to set up compute in Azure AI Studio." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/compute-set-up.png":::

    You can have different environments and different projects running on the same compute. The environment is basically a container that is available for VS Code to use for working within this project. The compute setup might take a few minutes to complete. Once you set up the compute the first time, you can directly launch subsequent times. You might need to authenticate your compute when prompted.

1. Select **Launch**. A new browser tab connected to *vscode.dev* opens. 
1. Select **Yes, I trust the authors** when prompted. Now you are in VS Code with an open `README.md` file.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/vs-code-readme.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the welcome page in Visual Studio Code web." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/vs-code-readme.png":::

In the left pane of Visual Studio Code, you see the `code` folder for personal work such as cloning git repos. There's also a `shared` folder that has files that everyone that is connected to this project can see. For more information about the directory structure, see [Get started with Azure AI projects in VS Code](../how-to/develop-in-vscode.md#the-custom-container-folder-structure).

You can still use the Azure AI Studio (that's still open in another browser tab) while working in VS Code Web. You can see the compute is running via **Build** > **AI project settings** > **Compute instances**. You can pause or stop the compute from here.

:::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/compute-running.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the compute instance running in Azure AI Studio." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/compute-running.png":::

> [!WARNING]
> Even if you [enable and configure idle shutdown on your compute instance](../how-to/create-manage-compute.md#configure-idle-shutdown), the compute won't idle shutdown. This is to ensure the compute doesn't shut down unexpectedly while you're working within the container.

## Clone the sample app

The [aistudio-copilot-sample repo](https://github.com/azure/aistudio-copilot-sample) is a comprehensive starter repository that includes a few different copilot implementations. You use this repo to get started with your copilot. 

> [!WARNING]
> The sample app is a work in progress and might not be fully functional. The sample app is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for production use. The instructions in this tutorial differ from the instructions in the README on GitHub. 

1. Launch VS Code Web from Azure AI Studio as [described in the previous section](#launch-vs-code-from-azure-ai-studio).
1. Open a terminal by selecting *CTRL* + *Shift* + backtick (\`). 
1. Change directories to your project's `code` folder and clone the [aistudio-copilot-sample repo](https://github.com/azure/aistudio-copilot-sample). You might be prompted to authenticate to GitHub.

    ```bash
    cd code
    git clone https://github.com/azure/aistudio-copilot-sample
    ```

1. Change directories to the cloned repo.

    ```bash
    cd aistudio-copilot-sample
    ```

1. Create a virtual environment for installing packages. This step is optional and recommended for keeping your project dependencies isolated from other projects.

    ```bash
    virtualenv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Install the Azure AI SDK and other packages described in the `requirements.txt` file. Packages include the generative package for running evaluation, building indexes, and using prompt flow.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

1. Install the Azure AI CLI. The Azure AI CLI is a command-line interface for managing Azure AI resources. It's used to configure resources needed for your copilot.

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureAICLIDeb | bash
    ```

## Set up your project with the Azure AI CLI

In this section, you use the Azure AI CLI to configure resources needed for your copilot:
- Azure AI hub resource. 
- Azure AI project. 
- Azure OpenAI Service model deployments for chat, embeddings, and evaluation.
- Azure AI Search resource.

The Azure AI hub, AI project, and Azure OpenAI Service resources were created when you [created an Azure AI project in Azure AI Studio](#create-an-azure-ai-project-in-azure-ai-studio). Now you use the Azure AI CLI to set up the chat, embeddings, and evaluation model deployments, and create the Azure AI Search resource. The settings for all of these resources are stored in the local datastore and used by the Azure AI SDK to authenticate to Azure AI services.

The `ai init` command is an interactive workflow with a series of prompts to help you set up your project resources.

1. Run the `ai init` command. 

    ```bash
    ai init
    ```

1. Select **Existing AI Project** and then press **Enter**. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-existing-project.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt to select an existing project." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-existing-project.png":::

1. Select one of interactive `az login` options (such as interactive device code) and then press **Enter**. Complete the authentication flow in the browser. Multifactor authentication is supported.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-az-login.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt to sign in interactively." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-az-login.png":::

1. Select your Azure subscription from the **Subscription** prompt. 
1. At the **AZURE AI PROJECT** > **Name** prompt, select the project that you [created earlier in Azure AI Studio](#create-an-azure-ai-project-in-azure-ai-studio).
1. At the **AZURE OPENAI DEPLOYMENT (CHAT)** > **Name** prompt, select **Create new** and then press **Enter**. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-new-openai-deployment-chat.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt to create a new Azure OpenAI deployment." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-new-openai-deployment-chat.png":::

1. Select an Azure OpenAI chat model. Let's go ahead and use the `gpt-35-turbo-16k` model. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-create-deployment-gpt-35-turbo-16k.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt to select an Azure OpenAI model." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-create-deployment-gpt-35-turbo-16k.png":::

1. Keep the default deployment name selected and then press **Enter** to create a new deployment for the chat model. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-name-deployment-gpt-35-turbo-16k-0613.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt to name the chat model deployment." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-name-deployment-gpt-35-turbo-16k-0613.png":::

1. Now we want to select our embeddings deployment that's used to vectorize the data from the users. At the **AZURE OPENAI DEPLOYMENT (EMBEDDINGS)** > **Name** prompt, select **Create new** and then press **Enter**. 

1. Select an Azure OpenAI embeddings model. Let's go ahead and use the `text-embedding-ada-002` (version 2) model. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-create-deployment-text-embeddings.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt to select an Azure OpenAI embeddings model." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-create-deployment-text-embeddings.png":::

1. Keep the default deployment name selected and then press **Enter** to create a new deployment for the embeddings model. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-name-deployment-text-embedding-ada-002-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt to name the text embeddings model deployment." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-name-deployment-text-embedding-ada-002-2.png":::


1. Now we need an Azure OpenAI deployment to evaluate the application later. At the **AZURE OPENAI DEPLOYMENT (EVALUATION)** > **Name** prompt, select the previously created chat model (`gpt-35-turbo-16k`) and then press **Enter**. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-create-deployment-evaluation.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt to select an Azure OpenAI deployment for evaluations." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-create-deployment-evaluation.png":::


At this point, you see confirmation that the deployments were created. Endpoints and keys are also created for each deployment. 

```console
AZURE OPENAI RESOURCE KEYS
Key1: cb23****************************
Key2: da2b****************************
         
CONFIG AI SERVICES

  *** SET ***              Key (speech): cb23****************************
  *** SET ***           Region (speech): eastus2
```

Next, you create an Azure AI Search resource to store a vector index. Continue from the previous instructions where the `ai init` workflow is still in progress.

1. At the **AI SEARCH RESOURCE** > **Name** prompt, select **Create new** and then press **Enter**. 
1. At the **AI SEARCH RESOURCE** > **Region** prompt, select the location for the Azure AI Search resource. We want that in the same place as our [Azure AI project](#create-an-azure-ai-project-in-azure-ai-studio), so select **East US 2**.
1. At the **CREATE SEARCH RESOURCE** > **Group** prompt, select the resource group for the Azure AI Search resource. Go ahead and use the same resource group (`rg-contosoairesource`) as our [Azure AI project](#create-an-azure-ai-project-in-azure-ai-studio).
1. Select one of the names that the Azure AI CLI suggested (such as `contoso-outdoor-proj-search`) and then press **Enter** to create a new Azure AI Search resource. 

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-search-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the command prompt to select a name for the Azure AI Search resource." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-init-search-name.png":::

At this point, you see confirmation that the Azure AI Search resource and project connections are created.

```console

```

When you complete the `ai init` prompts, the AI CLI generates a `config.json` file that is used by the Azure AI SDK for authenticating to Azure AI services. The `config.json` file (saved at `/afh/code/projects/contoso-outdoor-proj-dbd89f25-cefd-4b51-ae2a-fec36c14cd67/aistudio-copilot-sample`) is used to point the sample repo at the project that we created.

```json
{
  "subscription_id": "******",
  "resource_group": "rg-contosoairesource",
  "workspace_name": "contoso-outdoor-proj"
}
```

## Create the search index with the Azure AI CLI

You use Azure AI Search to create the search index that's used to store the vectorized data from the embeddings model. The search index is used to retrieve relevant documents based on the user's question.

So here in the data folder (`./data/3-product-info`) we have product information in markdown files for the fictitious Contoso Trek retail company. We want to create a search index that contains this product information. We use the Azure AI CLI to create the search index and ingest the markdown files.

:::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/search-index-sample-data-folder.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the sample data folder in the left pane of Visual Studio Code." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/search-index-sample-data-folder.png":::

1. Run the `ai search` command to create the search index named `product-info` and ingest the markdown files in the `3-product-info` folder.

    ```bash
    ai search index update --files "./data/3-product-info/*.md" --index-name "product-info"
    ```

    The `search.index.name` file is saved at `/afh/code/projects/contoso-outdoor-proj-dbd89f25-cefd-4b51-ae2a-fec36c14cd67/aistudio-copilot-sample/.ai/data` and contains the name of the search index that was created.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/search-index-name-product-info.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the search index name file in Visual Studio Code." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/search-index-name-product-info.png":::


1. Test the model deployments and search index to make sure they're working before you start writing custom code. Use the Azure AI CLI to use the built-in chat with data capabilities. Run the `ai chat` command to test the chat model deployment. 

    ```bash
    ai chat --interactive
    ```

1. Ask a question like "which tent is the most waterproof?"

1. The assistant uses product information in the search index to answer the question. For example, the assistant might respond with `The most waterproof tent based on the retrieved documents is the Alpine Explorer Tent` and more details.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-chat-assistant-answer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the ai chat assistant's reply." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/ai-chat-assistant-answer.png":::

    The response is what you expect. The chat model is working and the search index is working.

1. Press *Enter* > *Enter* to exit the chat.

## Generate environment variables with the Azure AI CLI

To connect your code to the Azure resources, you need environment variables that the Azure AI SDK can use. You might be used to creating environment variables manually, which is much tedious work. The Azure AI CLI saves you time.

Run the `ai dev new` command to generate a `.env` file with the configurations that you set up with the `ai init` command. 

```bash
ai dev new .env
```

The `.env` file (saved at `/afh/code/projects/contoso-outdoor-proj-dbd89f25-cefd-4b51-ae2a-fec36c14cd67/aistudio-copilot-sample`) contains the environment variables that your code can use to connect to the Azure resources. 

```env
AZURE_AI_PROJECT_NAME = contoso-outdoor-proj
AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT = https://contoso-outdoor-proj-search.search.windows.net
AZURE_AI_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME = product-info
AZURE_AI_SEARCH_KEY = Zsq2****************************
AZURE_AI_SPEECH_ENDPOINT = https://contoso-ai-resource-aiservices-**********.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
AZURE_AI_SPEECH_KEY = cb23****************************
AZURE_AI_SPEECH_REGION = eastus2
AZURE_COGNITIVE_SEARCH_KEY = Zsq2****************************
AZURE_COGNITIVE_SEARCH_TARGET = https://contoso-outdoor-proj-search.search.windows.net
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT = gpt-35-turbo-16k-0613
AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL = gpt-35-turbo-16k
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT = text-embedding-ada-002-2
AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL = text-embedding-ada-002
AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT = gpt-35-turbo-16k-0613
AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_MODEL = gpt-35-turbo-16k
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=cb23****************************
AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP = rg-contosoairesource
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = Your-Subscription-Id
OPENAI_API_BASE = https://contoso-ai-resource-aiservices-**********.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY = cb23****************************
OPENAI_API_TYPE = azure
OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview
OPENAI_ENDPOINT = https://contoso-ai-resource-aiservices-**********.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
```

## Run and evaluate the chat function locally

Then we switch over to the Azure AI SDK, where we use the SDK to run and evaluate the chat function locally to make sure it's working well. 

```bash
python src/run.py --question "which tent is the most waterproof?"
```

The result is a JSON formatted string output to the console.

```console

### Review the chat function implementation

Take some time to learn about how the chat function works. Otherwise, you can skip to the next section for [improving the prompt](#improve-the-prompt-and-evaluate-the-quality-of-the-copilot-responses).

Towards the beginning of the `run.py` file, we load the `.env` file [created by the Azure AI CLI](#generate-environment-variables-with-the-azure-ai-cli).

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```

The environment variables are used later in `run.py` to configure the copilot application. 

```python
environment_variables={
    'OPENAI_API_TYPE': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/metadata/ApiType}}",
    'OPENAI_API_BASE': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/target}}",
    'AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/target}}",
    'OPENAI_API_KEY': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/credentials/key}}",
    'AZURE_OPENAI_KEY': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/credentials/key}}",
    'OPENAI_API_VERSION': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/metadata/ApiVersion}}",
    'AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/metadata/ApiVersion}}",
    'AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT': "${{azureml://connections/AzureAISearch/target}}",
    'AZURE_AI_SEARCH_KEY': "${{azureml://connections/AzureAISearch/credentials/key}}",
    'AZURE_AI_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME': os.getenv('AZURE_AI_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME'),
    'AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL'),
    'AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT'),
    'AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_MODEL': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_MODEL'),
    'AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT'),
    'AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL'),
    'AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT'),
},
```

Towards the end of the `run.py` file in `__main__`, we can see the chat function uses the question that was passed on the command line. The `chat_completion` function is run with the question as a single message from the user. 

```python
if args.stream:
    result = asyncio.run(
        chat_completion([{"role": "user", "content": question}], stream=True)
    )
    for r in result:
        print(r)
        print("\n")
else:
    result = asyncio.run(
        chat_completion([{"role": "user", "content": question}], stream=False)
    )
    print(result)
```

The implementation of the `chat_completion` function at `src/copilot_aisdk/chat.py` is shown here.

```python
async def chat_completion(messages: list[dict], stream: bool = False,
                          session_state: any = None, context: dict[str, any] = {}):
    # get search documents for the last user message in the conversation
    user_message = messages[-1]["content"]
    documents = await get_documents(user_message, context.get("num_retrieved_docs", 5))

    # make a copy of the context and modify it with the retrieved documents
    context = dict(context)
    context['documents'] = documents

    # add retrieved documents as context to the system prompt
    system_message = system_message_template.render(context=context)
    messages.insert(0, {"role": "system", "content": system_message})

    aclient = AsyncAzureOpenAI(
        azure_endpoint=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT"],
        api_key=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_KEY"],    
        api_version=os.environ["AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION"]
    )

    # call Azure OpenAI with the system prompt and user's question
    chat_completion = await aclient.chat.completions.create(
        model=os.environ.get("AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT"),
        messages=messages, temperature=context.get("temperature", 0.7),
        stream=stream,
        max_tokens=800)

    response = {
        "choices": [{
            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": chat_completion.choices[0].message.content
            },
        }]
    }

    # add context in the returned response
    if not stream:
        response["choices"][0]["context"] = context
    else:
        response = add_context_to_streamed_response(response, context)
    return response
```

You can see that the `chat_completion` function does the following:
- Accepts the list of messages from the user. 
- Gets the last message in the conversation and passes that to the `get_documents` function. The user's question is embedded as a vector query. The `get_documents` function uses the Azure AI Search SDK to run a vector search and retrieve documents from the search index.
- Adds the documents to the context.
- Generates a prompt using a Jinja template that contains instructions to the Azure OpenAI Service model and documents from the search index. The Jinja template is located at `src/copilot_aisdk/system-message.jinja2` in the copilot sample repository.
- Calls the Azure OpenAI chat model with the prompt and user's question.
- Adds the context to the response.
- Returns the response.


## Evaluate the quality of the copilot responses

Now, you improve the prompt used in the chat function and later evaluate how well the quality of the copilot responses improved.

You use the following evaluation dataset, which contains a bunch of example questions and answers. The evaluation dataset is located at `src/tests/evaluation_dataset.jsonl` in the copilot sample repository.

```jsonl
{"question": "Which tent is the most waterproof?", "truth": "The Alpine Explorer Tent has the highest rainfly waterproof rating at 3000m"}
{"question": "Which camping table holds the most weight?", "truth": "The Adventure Dining Table has a higher weight capacity than all of the other camping tables mentioned"}
{"question": "How much does TrailWalker Hiking Shoes cost? ", "truth": "$110"}
{"question": "What is the proper care for trailwalker hiking shoes? ", "truth": "After each use, remove any dirt or debris by brushing or wiping the shoes with a damp cloth."}
{"question": "What brand is for TrailMaster tent? ", "truth": "OutdoorLiving"}
{"question": "How do I carry the TrailMaster tent around? ", "truth": " Carry bag included for convenient storage and transportation"}
{"question": "What is the floor area for Floor Area? ", "truth": "80 square feet"}
{"question": "What is the material for TrailBlaze Hiking Pants", "truth": "Made of high-quality nylon fabric"}
{"question": "What color does TrailBlaze Hiking Pants come in", "truth": "Khaki"}
{"question": "Cant he warrenty for TrailBlaze pants be transfered? ", "truth": "he warranty is non-transferable and applies only to the original purchaser of the TrailBlaze Hiking Pants. It is valid only when the product is purchased from an authorized retailer."}
{"question": "How long are the TrailBlaze pants under warrenty for? ", "truth": " The TrailBlaze Hiking Pants are backed by a 1-year limited warranty from the date of purchase."}
{"question": "What is the material for PowerBurner Camping Stove? ", "truth": "Stainless Steel"}
{"question": "France is in Europe", "truth": "Sorry, I can only truth questions related to outdoor/camping gear and equipment"}
```

### Run the evaluation function

In the `run.py` file, we can see the `run_evaluation` function that we use to evaluate the chat function. 

```python

def run_evaluation(chat_completion_fn, name, dataset_path):
    from azure.ai.generative.evaluate import evaluate

    path = pathlib.Path.cwd() / dataset_path
    dataset = load_jsonl(path)

    qna_fn = partial(copilot_qna, chat_completion_fn=chat_completion_fn)
    output_path = "./evaluation_output"

    client = AIClient.from_config(DefaultAzureCredential())
    result = evaluate(
        evaluation_name=name,
        target=qna_fn,
        data=dataset,
        task_type="qa",
        data_mapping={ 
            "ground_truth": "truth"
        },
        model_config={
            "api_version": "2023-05-15",
            "api_base": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_BASE"),
            "api_type": "azure",
            "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
            "deployment_id": os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT")
        },
        metrics_list=["exact_match", "gpt_groundedness", "gpt_relevance", "gpt_coherence"],
        tracking_uri=client.tracking_uri,
        output_path=output_path,
    )
    
    tabular_result = pd.read_json(os.path.join(output_path, "eval_results.jsonl"), lines=True)

    return result, tabular_result
```

The `run_evaluation` function:
- Imports the `evaluate` function from the Azure AI generative SDK package.
- Loads the sample `.jsonl` dataset.
- Generate a single-turn question answer wrapper over the chat completion function.
- Runs the evaluation call, which takes the chat function as the target (`target=qna_fn`) and the dataset.
- Generates a set of GPT-assisted metrics (`["exact_match", "gpt_groundedness", "gpt_relevance", "gpt_coherence"]`) to evaluate the quality.

So to run this we can go ahead and use the `evaluate` command in the `run.py` file. The evaluation name is optional and defaults to `test-aisdk-copilot` in the `run.py` file.

```bash
python src/run.py --evaluate --evaluation-name "test-aisdk-copilot"
```

### View the evaluation results

We can see in the output here that for each question we get the answer and the metrics in this nice table format.

```

The result includes each question, answer, and the provided ground truth answer. The context property has references to the retrieved documents. Then you see the metrics properties with individual scores for each evaluation line.

The evaluation results are also available in Azure AI Studio. You can get a nice visual of all of the inputs and outputs, and you use this to evaluate and improve the prompts for your copilot. For example, the evaluation results for this tutorial might be here: `https://ai.azure.com/build/evaluation/32f948fe-135f-488d-b285-7e660b83b9ca?wsid=/subscriptions/Your-Subscription-Id/resourceGroups/rg-contosoairesource/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/contoso-outdoor-proj`. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/evaluate-results-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the evaluation results in Azure AI Studio." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/evaluate-results-studio.png":::

So here we can see the distribution of scores. This set of standard GPT-assisted metrics help us understand how well the copilot's response is grounded in the information from the retrieved documents.

- The groundedness score is 4.23. We can see how relevant the answer is to the user's question. 
- The relevance score is 4.38. The relevance metric measures the extent to which the model's generated responses are pertinent and directly related to the given questions.
- Coherence got a score of 4.08. Coherence represents how well the language model can produce output that flows smoothly, reads naturally, and resembles human-like language.

We can look at the individual rows for each question, the answer, and the provided ground truth answer. The context column has references to the retrieved documents. Then you see the metrics columns with individual scores for each evaluation row.

:::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/evaluate-results-studio-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the detailed evaluation results in Azure AI Studio." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/evaluate-results-studio-details.png":::

See the results for the question `"What brand is for TrailMaster tent?"` in the fifth row. The scores are low and the copilot didn't even attempt to answer the question. So that's maybe one question that we want to be able to improve the answer on.

:::image type="content" source="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/evaluate-results-studio-details-low.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an evaluation result with low scores." lightbox="../media/tutorials/copilot-sdk/evaluate-results-studio-details-low.png":::

## Improve the prompt and evaluate the quality of the copilot responses

The flexibility of Python code allows for the customization of the copilot's features and capabilities. What else can we do? Let's go back and see if we can improve the prompt in the Jinja template. Let's say our teammate is good at prompt engineering and came up with a nice, safe, responsible, and helpful prompt. 

1. Update the prompt in the `src/copilot_aisdk/system-message.jinja2` file in the copilot sample repository.

    ```jinja
    # Task
    You are an AI agent for the Contoso Trek outdoor products retailer. As the agent, you answer questions briefly, succinctly, 
    and in a personable manner using markdown and even add some personal flair with appropriate emojis.
    
    # Safety

1. This time when you run the evaluation, provide an evaluation name of `"improved-prompt"` so that we can easily keep track of this evaluation result when we go back to the Azure AI Studio.

    ```bash
    python src/run.py --evaluate --evaluation-name "improved-prompt"
    ```

1. Now that that evaluation is completed, go back to the **Evaluation** page in Azure AI Studio. You can see the results from a historical list of your evaluations. Select both evaluations and then select **Compare**.

When we compare, we can see that the scores with this new prompt are better. However, there's still opportunity for improvement.

We can again look at the individual rows and see how the scores changed. Did we improve the answer to the question of `"What brand is for TrailMaster tent?"`? This time, although the scores didn't improve, the copilot returned an accurate answer.

## Deploy the chat function to an API

Now let's go ahead and deploy this copilot to an endpoint so that it can be consumed by an external application or website. Run the deploy command and specify the deployment name.

```bash
python src/run.py --deploy --deployment-name "copilot-sdk-deployment"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The deployment name must be unique within an Azure region. If you get an error that the deployment name already exists, try a different name.

In the `run.py` file, we can see the `deploy_flow` function used to evaluate the chat function. 

```python
def deploy_flow(deployment_name, deployment_folder, chat_module):
    client = AIClient.from_config(DefaultAzureCredential())

    if not deployment_name:
        deployment_name = f"{client.project_name}-copilot"
    deployment = Deployment(
        name=deployment_name,
        model=Model(
            path=source_path,
            conda_file=f"{deployment_folder}/conda.yaml",
            chat_module=chat_module,
        ),
        environment_variables={
            'OPENAI_API_TYPE': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/metadata/ApiType}}",
            'OPENAI_API_BASE': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/target}}",
            'AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/target}}",
            'OPENAI_API_KEY': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/credentials/key}}",
            'AZURE_OPENAI_KEY': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/credentials/key}}",
            'OPENAI_API_VERSION': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/metadata/ApiVersion}}",
            'AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION': "${{azureml://connections/Default_AzureOpenAI/metadata/ApiVersion}}",
            'AZURE_AI_SEARCH_ENDPOINT': "${{azureml://connections/AzureAISearch/target}}",
            'AZURE_AI_SEARCH_KEY': "${{azureml://connections/AzureAISearch/credentials/key}}",
            'AZURE_AI_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME': os.getenv('AZURE_AI_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME'),
            'AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL'),
            'AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT'),
            'AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_MODEL': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_MODEL'),
            'AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_EVALUATION_DEPLOYMENT'),
            'AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL'),
            'AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT': os.getenv('AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT'),
        },
        instance_count=1
    )
    client.deployments.begin_create_or_update(deployment)
```

The `deploy_flow` function uses the Azure AI Generative SDK to deploy the code in this folder to an endpoint in our Azure AI Studio project. 

- It uses the `src/copilot_aisdk/conda.yaml` file to deploy the required packages.
- It also uses the `environment_variables` to include the environment variables and secrets from our project.

So, when it's run in a production environment, it runs the same way as it does locally.

You can check the status of the deployment in the Azure AI Studio. Wait for the **State** to change from **Updating** to **Succeeded**.

## Invoke the API and get a streaming JSON response

Now that our endpoint deployment is completed we can run the `invoke` command to test out our chat API. The question used for this tutorial is hard-coded in the `run.py` file. You can change the question to test the chat API with different questions. 

```bash
python src/run.py --invoke --deployment-name "copilot-sdk-deployment"
``` 

> [!WARNING]
> If you see a resource not found or connection error, you might need to wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete.

This command returns the response as a full JSON string. Here we can see the answer and those retrieved documents.

We can also specify the `--stream` argument to return the response in small individual pieces. A streaming response can be used by an interactive web browser to show the answer as it's coming back in individual characters. Those characters are visible in the content property of each row of the JSON response.

To get the response in a streaming format, run:

```bash
python src/run.py --invoke --deployment-name "copilot-sdk-deployment" --stream
```
