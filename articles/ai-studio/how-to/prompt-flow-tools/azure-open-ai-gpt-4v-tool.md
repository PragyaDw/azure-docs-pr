# Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision tool in Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

The prompt flow *Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision* tool enables you to use your Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model deployment to analyze images and provide textual responses to questions about them.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription.

    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at <a href="https://aka.ms/oai/access" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/oai/access</a>. Open an issue on this repo to contact us if you have an issue.

- An [Azure AI hub resource](../../how-to/create-azure-ai-resource.md) with a GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model deployed in one of the regions that support GPT-4 Turbo with Vision: Australia East, Switzerland North, Sweden Central, and West US. When you deploy from your project's **Deployments** page, select: `gpt-4` as the model name and `vision-preview` as the model version.

## Build with the Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision tool

1. Create or open a flow in [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com). For more information, see [Create a flow](../flow-develop.md).
1. Select **+ More tools** > **Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision** to add the Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision tool to your flow.

1. Select the connection to your Azure OpenAI Service. For example, you can select the **Default_AzureOpenAI** connection. For more information, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).
1. Enter values for the Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision tool input parameters described [here](#inputs). For example, you can use this example prompt:

    ```jinja
    # system:
    As an AI assistant, your task involves interpreting images and responding to questions about the image.
    Remember to provide accurate answers based on the information present in the image.
    
    # user:
    Can you tell me what the image depicts?
    ![image]({{image_input}})
    ```

1. Select **Validate and parse input** to validate the tool inputs.
1. Specify an image to analyze in the `image_input` input parameter. For example, you can upload an image or enter the URL of an image to analyze. Otherwise you can paste or drag and drop an image into the tool.
1. Add more tools to your flow as needed, or select **Run** to run the flow.
1. The outputs are described [here](#outputs).

Here's an example output response:

```json
{
    "system_metrics": {
        "completion_tokens": 96,
        "duration": 4.874329,
        "prompt_tokens": 1157,
        "total_tokens": 1253
    },
    "output": "The image depicts a user interface for Azure's OpenAI GPT-4 service. It is showing a configuration screen where settings related to the AI's behavior can be adjusted, such as the model (GPT-4), temperature, top_p, frequency penalty, etc. There's also an area where users can enter a prompt to generate text, and an option to include an image input for the AI to interpret, suggesting that this particular interface supports both text and image inputs."
}
```

## Inputs

The following are available input parameters:

| Name | Type | Description | Required |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- | -------- |
| connection             | AzureOpenAI | The Azure OpenAI connection to be used in the tool.                                              | Yes      |
| deployment\_name       | string      | The language model to use.                                                                      | Yes      |
| prompt                 | string      | Text prompt that the language model uses to generate its response. The Jinja template for composing prompts in this tool follows a similar structure to the chat API in the LLM tool. To represent an image input within your prompt, you can use the syntax `![image]({{INPUT NAME}})`. Image input can be passed in the `user`, `system` and `assistant` messages.                 | Yes      |
| max\_tokens            | integer     | Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. Default is 512.                      | No       |
| temperature            | float       | Randomness of the generated text. Default is 1.                                            | No       |
| stop                   | list        | Stopping sequence for the generated text. Default is null.                                 | No       |
| top_p                  | float       | Probability of using the top choice from the generated tokens. Default is 1.               | No       |
| presence\_penalty      | float       | Value that controls the model's behavior regarding repeating phrases. Default is 0.      | No       |
| frequency\_penalty     | float       | Value that controls the model's behavior regarding generating rare phrases. Default is 0. | No       |

## Outputs

The following are available output parameters:

| Return Type | Description                              |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| string      | The text of one response of conversation |
