# Quickstart: Onboarding to Trusted Signing

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: In the opening sentence, focus on the job or task to be completed, emphasizing
general industry terms (such as "serverless," which are better for SEO) more than
Microsoft-branded terms or acronyms (such as "Azure Functions" or "ACR"). That is, try
to include terms people typically search for and avoid using *only* Microsoft terms.

After the opening sentence, summarize the steps taken in the article to answer "what is this
article about?" Then include a brief statement of cost, if applicable.

Example: 
Get started with Azure Functions by using command-line tools to create a function that responds 
to HTTP requests. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless environment 
of Azure Functions. Completing this quickstart incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less 
in your Azure account.

Trusted Signing is a service with an intuitive experience for developers and IT professionals. It supports both public and private trust signing scenarios and includes a timestamping service that is publicly trusted in Windows. We currently support public trust, private trust, VBS enclave, and test trust signing. Completing this quickstart guides gives you an overview of the service and onboarding steps!

<!-- - Avoid links, which are generally invitations for the reader to leave the article and
not complete the experience of the quickstart. The exception are links to alternate versions
of the same content (e.g. when you have a VS Code-oriented article and a CLI-oriented article). Those
links help get the reader to the right article, rather than being a distraction. If you feel that there are
other important concepts needing links, make reviewing a particular article a prerequisite. Otherwise, rely
on the line of standard links (see below).

- Avoid any indication of the time it takes to complete the quickstart, because there's already
the "x minutes to read" at the top and making a second suggestion can be contradictory. (The standard line is probably misleading, but that's a matter for site design.)

- Avoid a bullet list of steps or other details in the quickstart: the H2's shown on the right
of the docs page already fulfill this purpose.

- Avoid screenshots or diagrams: the opening sentence should be sufficient to explain the result,
and other diagrams count as conceptual material that is best in a linked overview.

<!-- Optional standard links: if there are suitable links, you can include a single line
of applicable links for companion content at the end of the introduction. Don't use the line
if there's only a single link. In general, these links are more important for SDK-based quickstarts. -->
