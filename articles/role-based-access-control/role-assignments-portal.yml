      Step 2: Open the Add role assignment page
    summary: |
      **Access control (IAM)** is the page that you typically use to assign roles to grant access to Azure resources. It's also known as identity and access management (IAM) and appears in several locations in the Azure portal.

        Click **Access control (IAM)**.

          The following shows an example of the Access control (IAM) page for a resource group.

      Step 5: (Optional) Add condition
    summary: |
      If you selected a role that supports conditions, a **Conditions** tab will appear and you have the option to add a condition to your role assignment. A [condition](conditions-overview.md) is an additional check that you can optionally add to your role assignment to provide more fine-grained access control.

      The **Conditions** tab will look different depending on the role you selected.
    
      ### Delegate condition

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Delegating Azure role assignment management with conditions is currently in PREVIEW.
      > See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.

      If you selected one of the following privileged roles, follow the steps in this section.

      - [Owner](built-in-roles.md#owner)
      - [Role Based Access Control Administrator](built-in-roles.md#role-based-access-control-administrator)
      - [User Access Administrator](built-in-roles.md#user-access-administrator)

      1. On the **Conditions** tab under **What user can do**, select the **Allow user to only assign selected roles to selected principals (fewer privileges)** option.

          :::image type="content" source="./media/shared/condition-constrained.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Add role assignment with the Constrained option selected." lightbox="./media/shared/condition-constrained.png":::

      1. Click **Select roles and principals** to add a condition that constrains the roles and principals this user can assign roles to.

      1. Follow the steps in [Delegate Azure role assignment management to others with conditions](delegate-role-assignments-portal.md#step-3-add-a-condition).
